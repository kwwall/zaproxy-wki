# Plug-n-Hack

Plug-n-Hack is a proposed standard from the Mozilla security team for defining how security tools can
interact with browsers in a more useful and usable way.

This add-on adds a 'Plug-n-Hack' button to the Quickstart tab - clicking on this button will allow you
to configure your browser to work with ZAP quickly and easily.

It also allows you to control ZAP from your browser. In Firefox this is supported via the Developer Toolbar
(Shift+F2).<br>Type 'help pnh' or 'help zap' in the Firefox Developer toolbar to get started.<br>
<br>
Plug-n-Hack is currently supported by Firefox 24.0 and later. <br>For more details about Plug-n-Hack including<br>
the latest information about which browsers and tools support it see: <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plug-n-Hack'>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plug-n-Hack</a>
