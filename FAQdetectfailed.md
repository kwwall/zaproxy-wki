# What should I do if ZAP doesnt detect a known problem?

If ZAP fails to detect a known problem then please let us know!

Obviously the more information you can give us the better, and the best option would be a simple one page 'proof of concept' in the form of a [wavsep](http://code.google.com/p/wavsep/) test - we can then include those in our regression tests.

You can let us know via:
  * A [new issue](http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/issues/entry)
  * The [developers group](http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop)
  * A private email to psiinon at gmail dot com
