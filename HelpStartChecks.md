# Scanner Rules

ZAP supports both [active](HelpStartConceptsAscan) and [passive](HelpStartConceptsPscan) scanning rules.

All rules are contained in [add-ons](HelpStartConceptsAddons) so that they can be updated quickly and easily.<br>By default ZAP ships with just the 'Release' quality rules, but you can install 'Beta' and 'Alpha' quality rules via the <a href='HelpUiDialogsManageaddons'>Manage Add-ons dialog</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href='HelpStartConceptsScanpolicy'>Scan Policies</a> define which rules run and how they run.<br>You can have as many scan policies as you like to cover different situations.<br>
<br>
To manage scan policies open the <a href='HelpUiDialogsScanpolicymgr'>Scan Policy Manager dialog</a>
