# Quick Start

The Quick Start tab provides you with an easy way to quickly test a web application.

Enter the URL of your target application and press the 'Attack' button.

ZAP will spider the target and then attack it with the active scanner.

For a more in depth test you should explore your application using your browser or automated regression
tests while proxying through ZAP.
