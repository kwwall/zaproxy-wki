# Options Http Sessions screen

This screen allows you to configure the [Http Sessions Extension's](HelpStartConceptsHttpsessions) options:
### Default Tokens
These are the names of the Cookies that are considered by default to be session tokens. As soon they
are detected as parameters on a Site, they are automatically added as session tokens for that Site, unless
manually overriden by user command.

The session tokens are used case-insensitive, therefore the default session tokens will automatically
be lower-cased. Also, any modifications of the default session tokens are visible only after the revisit
of the Site's pages.
### Enable for Proxy only
If this option is enabled, the Extension will only process the messages sent and received through the
Proxy (e.g. from/to the browser). The messages from other Extensions are processed only if this option
is disabled.
