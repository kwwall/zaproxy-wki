# Google Summer of Code 2012

There were 3 ZAP related Google Summer of Code 2012 projects :)

All 3 projects were very successful and have significantly enhanced ZAP!

Guifre's AJAX Spider project is available as an extension which can be added to the current release of ZAP: https://code.google.com/p/zap-extensions/

Cosmin's and Robert's projects are available in the trunk and will form a very significant part of the next ZAP release: 2.0.0
