# The API UI
The API is partially 'self documenting' in that you can explore it via your browser and see all of the functionality that it supports.

When proxying via ZAP go to http://zap/ and you should see this screen:

This is the top level and shows you all of the component which currently support the API.

If you click on the 'core' link you will see:

  * Actions : these control ZAP

The API is available in JSON, XML and HTML formats.
