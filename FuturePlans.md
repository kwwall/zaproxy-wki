# ZAP future Plans

Here are some of the features planned to be added or improved:
  * Fuzzing (using [JBroFuzz](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_JBroFuzz))
  * Enhanced automated scanning, both passive and active
  * Enhanced spider, perhaps as a passive background thread
  * Technology fingerprinting
  * Internationalization - made good progress in v1.1.0, but not yet complete
  * Interaction with the Firefox Hackbar extension
  * Localization - please get in touch if you can help with this
  * More help pages, especially on manual testing techniques

Which of these would you most like to see first?<br>
What else would you like to see?<br>
Please <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop'>get in touch</a>.<br>
<br>
Ideally any significant additional functionality will be added by integrating existing libraries.<br>
This will only be possible where there are java open source libraries of a suitable quality.<br>
If you have developed or know of a library you think may be suitable then please <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop'>get in touch</a>.
