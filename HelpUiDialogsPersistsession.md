# Persist Session dialog
This dialog is shown by default whenever you start a new session, which always happens when ZAP starts.<br>It<br>
allows you to specify how you would like this session persisted, you can also set the default choice<br>
so that you are not prompted again.<br>
<br>
Persisting a session means it will be stored in a local database that you can access at a later date.<br>You<br>
do not need to keep 'saving' a session as everything that happens in the session is continually recorded.<br>It<br>
is much faster to persist a session at the start, but you can always persist a session later if you need<br>
to.<br>If you close ZAP without persisting your session then you will not be able to access it again.<br>
<h3>Yes, I want to persist this session with name based on the current timestamp</h3>
