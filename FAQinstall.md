# Where is ZAP installed

ZAP is installed in different places depending on the OS:

## Windows 7
Underneath the 'Program Files (x86)' directory, e.g.
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy
```

## Windows XP
Underneath the 'Program Files' directory, e.g.
```
C:\Program Files\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy
```

## Linux
The Linux package is actually just a tar.gz file, so ZAP will be 'installed' wherever you expand the archive.

## Mac OS
Same as for Linux, the Mac OS package is just a zip file. The contained "Owasp ZAP" app can be executed instantly, regardless of the directory. As for any other Mac application, most users preferably put the app into the /Applications directory.
