# Active Scan

Active scanning attempts to find potential vulnerabilities by using known attacks against the selected
targets.

Active scanning is an attack on those targets. <br>You should NOT use it on web applications that you do<br>
not own.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that active scanning can only find certain types of vulnerabilities.<br>Logical vulnerabilities,<br>
such as broken access control, will not be found by any active or automated vulnerability scanning.<br>Manual<br>
penetration testing should always be performed in addition to active scanning to find all types of vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Active scanning is configured using the <a href='HelpUiDialogsOptionsAscan'>Options Active Scan screen</a>.<br>The rules that run are configured via <a href='HelpStartConceptsScanpolicy'>Scan Policies</a> - you can have as many of these as you like.<br>
