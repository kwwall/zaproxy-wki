Please note that we will happily host ZAP add-ons on the [ZAP Marketplace](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/) which will make it much easier for ZAP users to descover, install and update your add-ons, as long as we can build and sanity check them ourselves (to reduce the chance of malicious code;).

Post to the [ZAP Developer](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) group to ask for your add-on to be hosted by us.
