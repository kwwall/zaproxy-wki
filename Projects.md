# Projects

This page details projects suitable for people new to ZAP to work on.

They are intended to be non-trivial enhancements and could be ideal for students working in higher education to implement as part of their courses. However they are not restricted to students - anyone can work on them.

If you are interested in working on one of these projects then please get in touch. We will need to flesh out the projects in more detail ;)

If you are looking for a easier way to get into the code then have a look at issues with the [IdealFirstBug](http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/issues/list?q=label:IdealFirstBug) tag - they should be relatively easy and fairly well documented issues.

We have some [advice](ProjectAdvice) for working on ZAP developments.

And do check of the blog posts about [ZAP development](http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/Development).
