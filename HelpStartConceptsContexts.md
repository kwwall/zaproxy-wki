# Contexts

Contexts are a way of relating a set of URLs together.<br>You can define any contexts you like, but it is<br>
expected that a context will correspond to a web application.<br>It is recommended that you define a new<br>
contexts for each web application that makes up the system you are testing, and set them in scope as<br>
you test each one.<br>
<br>
Contexts are defined as a set of regular expressions (regexs) which are applied to all of the URLs in<br>
the <a href='HelpUiTabsSites'>Sites tab</a>.<br>You can configure contexts via:<br>
<ul><li>Right click menu items in the in the Sites or History tab<br>
</li><li>The <a href='HelpUiDialogsSessionContexts'>Session Contexts dialogs</a>.<br>
