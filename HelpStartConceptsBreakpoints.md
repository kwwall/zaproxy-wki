# Break Points

A break point allows you to intercept a request from your browser and to change it before is is submitted
to the web application you are testing.<br>You can also change the responses received from the application<br>The<br>
request or response will be displayed in the <a href='HelpUiTabsBreak'>Break tab</a> which allows you to change disabled or hidden fields, and will allow you to bypass client side validation (often enforced using javascript).<br>It is an essential penetration testing technique.<br>
<br>
You can set a 'global' break point on requests and/or responses using the buttons on the <a href='HelpUiTltoolbar'>top level toolbar</a>.<br>All requests and/or responses will then be intercepted by ZAP allowing you to change anything before allowing the request or response to continue.<br>
<br>
You can also set break points on specific criteria using the "Break..." right click menu on the <a href='HelpUiTabsSites'>Sites</a> and <a href='HelpUiTabsHistory'>History tabs</a> and the 'Add a custom HTTP break point' button on the <a href='HelpUiTltoolbar'>top level toolbar</a>.<br>Only requests and responses which match those criteria will be intercepted by ZAP.<br>Custom break points are shown in the <a href='HelpUiTabsBreakpoints'>Break Points tab</a>
