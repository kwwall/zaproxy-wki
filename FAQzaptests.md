# [FAQ:](FAQtoplevel) What does ZAP test for?

ZAP supports both [active](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsAscan) and [passive](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpStartConceptsPscan) scanning.

By default ZAP comes with the following 'release' quality rules:

  * [Release Active Scan Rules](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpAddonsAscanrulesAscanrules)
  * [Release Passive Scan Rules](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpAddonsPscanrulesPscanrules)

But you can also download and install:

  * [Beta Active Scan Rules](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/wiki/HelpAddonsAscanrulesBetaAscanbeta)
  * [Beta Passive Scan Rules](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/wiki/HelpAddonsPscanrulesBetaPscanbeta)
  * [Alpha Active Scan Rules](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/wiki/HelpAddonsAscanrulesAlphaAscanalpha)
  * [Alpha Passive Scan Rules](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/wiki/HelpAddonsPscanrulesAlphaPscanalpha)

from the [ZAP Marketplace](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/wiki).

And there are also these scripts in the [community scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts) repo:
  * [Active scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts/tree/master/active)
  * [Passive scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts/tree/master/passive)

The full list of reserved scan ids is maintained in [scanners.md](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/src/doc/scanners.md)
