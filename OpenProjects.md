# Open Projects

Projects are non trivial enhancements that are (mostly) self contained, and should be suitable for:
  * Student course work
  * Google summer of code (if/when we take part)
  * Mozilla Winter of Security
  * OWASP Code Sprints
  * Anyone who would like a non trivial ZAP project to work on ;)

### For an up to date list of projects see: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/labels/project

If you are interested in any of these projects please post to the relevant issue or post to the [ZAP Developer Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop).
