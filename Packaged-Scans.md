The ZAP [Docker](Docker) images include packaged scans which make it easy to run ZAP for specific purposes:

* [Baseline Scan](ZAP-Baseline-Scan) - a time limited spider which reports issues found passively
* [API Scan](ZAP-API-Scan) - a full scan of an API defined using OpenAPI / Swagger or SOAP
* [Full Scan](ZAP-API-Scan) - a full scan of any site
