## Become a ZAP Evangelist
For information about the ZAP Evangelists and how to join up see the [ZAP Evangelists wiki page](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/ZapEvangelists)

## Help Improve the Documentation
The source for the ZAP [User Guide](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki) is underneath the zap-core-tree repo [src/help/zaphelp/contents](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/tree/master/src/help/zaphelp/contents) directory.

The Java Help included with ZAP and the online version are both generated from these HTML pages. Send Pull Requests to help us improve it.

## Improve existing scan rules or write new ones
The scan rules define how ZAP can automatically detect vulnerabilities.

We are always looking to improve existing ones and add new ones, so this is a great place to start helping with the ZAP code base.

More details can be found in the [Hacking ZAP blog posts](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Development#Hacking_ZAP)

## Improve existing add-ons or write new ones
Much of the ZAP functionality is implemented as add-ons, even features that are included 'as standard' in ZAP releases.

Add-on are a great way to extend ZAP and can be ideal for student projects - many of the existing add-ons have been implemented by students, either through programs like Google Summer of Code and the Mozilla Winter of Security or directly as part of course work.

If you are interested in working on existing or new add-ons then the [Developer Group](http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) is the best place to ask questions.

## Improve the ZAP core
The ZAP 'core' underpins all of the other ZAP features, and so ensuring it is as robust as possible is very important.

Fixing [https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues](Issues) is very valuable and there are always many core improvements we want to make, again the [Developer Group](http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) is the best place to discuss these.
