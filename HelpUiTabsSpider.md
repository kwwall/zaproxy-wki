# Spider tab

The Spider tab shows you the set of unique URIs found by the [Spider](HelpStartConceptsSpider) during the scans.

The 'New Scan' button launches the [Spider dialog](HelpUiDialogsSpider) which allows you to specify exactly what should be scanned.<br>The Spider can be run on multiple Sites in parallel and the results for each scan are shown by selecting the scan via the 'Progress' pull-down.<br>
<br>
The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and resume the scan. A progress<br>
bar shows how far the scan selected via the Progress pull-down has progressed.<br>
<br>For each request you can see:<br>
<ul><li>Processed - Whether the URI was processed by the Spider or was skipped from fetching because of a rule (e.g. it was out of scope)<br>
</li><li>Method - The HTTP method, e.g. GET or POST, through which the resource should be accessed<br>
</li><li>URI - the resource found<br>
</li><li>Flags - any information about the URI (e.g. if it's a seed or why was it not processed)<br>
