# Google Summer of Code 2016
OWASP has been accepted to the Google Summer of Code, which means students can get paid to work on ZAP over the summer holidays!

We have some suggested projects on the [OWASP wiki](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSOC2016_Ideas#OWASP_ZAP) but we're also very open to other projects as well.

If you're interested then please get in touch with us via the [ZAP Developer Group](http://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop) and be aware that students who get in touch and start contributing before GSoC starts will be at an advantage to those who have not.
