# GUI Programming
## Introduction

Getting started with GUI programming is hard. A graphical tool, that lets you inspect the internal structure can help to understand how a user interface is composed. [SwingExplorer](http://www.swingexplorer.com) can be used for such purpose.

## Setup Run Configuration for `SwingExplorer`

  1. First, setup your desired branch of ZAP in eclipse, as described under [Building](Building). In this setup I did it for the websockets branch.
  1. Download `swexpl.jar` and `swag.jar` from [SwingExplorer download page](http://www.swingexplorer.com/?page=download). You have to provide your name and your e-mail address. However, the software is freeware.
  1. Place the `jar`-files into your eclipse project under a new folder named `swingexplorer`.
  1. In eclipse go to `Menu > Run > Run Configurations`:
    1. right click onto _Java Application_ and select _New_
    1. select your ZAP project if it is not already selected
    1. as _Main Class_ enter
```
org.swingexplorer.Launcher
```
    1. in the `Arguments` tab enter:
      * as _Program Argument_
```
org.zaproxy.zap.ZAP
```
      * as _VM Arguments_
```
-javaagent:../swingexplorer/swag.jar
-Xbootclasspath/a:../swingexplorer/swag.jar
-Dswex.mport=63812
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
```
      * as _Working directory_ select _Custom_ and enter (as you've done with the run configuration for ZAP)
```
${workspace_loc:zaproxy-websockets/bin}
```
    1. in the _Classpath_ tab select _User Entries_ and press the _Add JARs_ button: select the `swexpl.jar` from your `swingexplorer` directory
    1. Finally _Apply_ the settings and _Run_ your new configuration
