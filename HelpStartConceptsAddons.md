# Add-ons

Add-ons add additional functionality to ZAP.<br>They have full access to all of the ZAP internals, and so<br>
can provide very powerful new features.<br>You can dynamically install add-ons from the online Add-on Marketplace<br>
via the <a href='HelpUiDialogsManageaddons'>Manage Add-ons dialog</a>.<br>You can typically add and remove add-ons to and from the ZAP UI without having to restart it.<br>

Add-ons can provide context sensitive help which is dynamically integrated with the help file.<br>If you<br>
are reading this page via a ZAP help file (as opposed to reading it online) then any help pages associated<br>
with the add-ons you have installed will be available under <a href='HelpAddonIntroduction'>here</a>.<br>

Add-ons are assigned a status which may be one of:<br>
<table>
<tr><td></td><td>Release</td><td>which indicates they are of high quality and fit for purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Beta</td><td>which indicates they are of reasonable quality but may be incomplete or need further testing</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Alpha</td><td>which indicates they are at an early stage of development</td></tr>
</table>
