# Weekly Releases

We generate weekly releases of ZAP from the trunk, typically every Monday, available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/zaproxy/files/weekly/

The details of the changes in each weekly release are on the WeeklyFixes wiki page.

These are just intended for people who want to use all of the features we've added since the last 'full' release but dont want the hassle of building ZAP from the source code.

While we endeavor to ensure that weekly releases are robust, things may be broken or only partially implemented.

If you have not used ZAP before it might be better to start with the latest 'full' release.

We will still carry on doing full releases, which we expect most people to continue to use.

For background to weekly releases see [this post](http://zaproxy.blogspot.com/2012/10/zap-weekly-releases.html) on the official ZAP blog.
