# ZAP Extensions

There are lots of examples of extensions under the [org.zaproxy.zap.extension](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/tree/develop/src/org/zaproxy/zap/extension) package and in the [zap-extensions](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/) project.

Extensions are loaded from the 'plugins' directory.
