# ZAP Extensions

There are lots of examples of extensions under the [org.zaproxy.zap.extension](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/source/browse/trunk/src/org/#org%2Fzaproxy%2Fzap%2Fextension) package and in the [zap-extensions](https://code.google.com/p/zap-extensions/) project.

Extensions are loaded from the 'plugins' directory.
