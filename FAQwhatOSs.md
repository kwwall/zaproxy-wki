# What operating systems are supported?

ZAP should run on all operating systems that support Java 7 - it can even run on a [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/zappi)!

Note that the ZAP Mac OS release includes Java 7 with it and should run without any problems on older Macs like OSX 10.6.8.

If you experience any problems running ZAP then please report them to us.
