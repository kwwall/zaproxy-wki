# New Home Page

## Summary

ZAP effectively has 2 homepages:
  * http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/
  * https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project
Neither are ideal - this proposal is for 'replacing' them with a new home page, which will have a new URL.

## What is this proposal trying to solve

  * Currently have 2 homepages
  * Neither are easy for new people to find info
  * They are not that visually great
  * They are not internationalized
  * They arent very usable via mobile devices

## The proposal

We will have a new set of homepages, which will be:
  * Easy for new people to understand and use
  * Much more visually appealing
  * Internationalized (via Crowdin)
  * Relatively static (see below)
  * Work well for both desktops and mobile devices

The URL could be either:
  * zaproxy.org
  * zap.owasp.org

The homepage will have a short, simple 'overview' and then take people through what we think are the most likely questions that people will have.

Essentially it will be a relatively short tree of questions, with the 'answers' taking the user to the real content, which may stay on one (or both) of the existing homepages. However anyone going directly to these pages will be directed to the new homepage.

Initial attempt at the questions (terse version!):
  * What do you want?
    * Downloads - redirect to downloads
    * More info (need to split up?)
      * Functionality
      * Features
      * Usecases
      * Screenshots
      * Videos
      * Slides
      * News
      * Talks
      * Evangelists
      * Blog posts?
      * Related projects
    * Help
      * FAQs
      * User guide
      * User Group
      * Report issue
    * Internal details
      * Source code
      * Developer group
      * Contributing
      * Javadocs
      * Wiki...

Second attempt: [Frontpage](NewHomeIndex)

What will the homepage look like visually? Well I quite like these sites:
  * http://phantomjs.org/index.html
  * http://sammyjs.org/docs
  * http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html
but more suggestions appreciated.

I'm expecting to pay to have the site designed (not my area of expertise;) but if anyone fancies having a go then please do!

I'm not sure where this will be hosted yet - again, suggestions appreciated.

We have project funds, and I think this is a good thing to spend some of them on, but I do think its up to us to decide the content.

Questions
  * Does this proposal make sense, or do I need to explain anything better?
  * Do you agree with the overall suggestion?
  * Any preferences on the URL?
  * Other websites that could be used for inspiration?
  * Suggestions for improvements to the questions tree?
  * Anyone know of good website designers we could use?
  * Suggestions for hosting?
