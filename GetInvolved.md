# ZAP Get Involved
<p>
Involvement in the development of ZAP is actively encouraged!<br>
You do <b>not</b> have to be a security expert in order to contribute.<br>
<br>
Some of the ways you can help:<br>
<p>
<h3>Promote ZAP</h3>
While ZAP is becoming increasingly popular, there are still many people who could benefit from it who havnt heard about it.<br>
<br>
You can help by:<br>
<ul><li>Blogging about ZAP<br>
</li><li>Tweeting about ZAP (be sure to include <a href='https://twitter.com/zaproxy'>@zaproxy</a>)<br>
</li><li>Starring and/or G+1'ing this project (and zap-extensions)<br>
</li><li>Reviewing ZAP in sites like <a href='http://www.ohloh.net/p/zaproxy'>ohloh</a>
</li><li>Telling people you use it<br>
</li><li>Giving talks about it - and let us know if you need help with slides etc</li></ul>

<h3>Feature Requests</h3>
Please raise new feature requests as enhancement requests here: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues<br>
If there are existing requests you are also interested in then please 'star' them - that way we can see which features people are most interested in and can prioritize them accordingly.<br>
<br>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
Please use the <a href='https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop'>zaproxy-develop Google Group</a> for feedback:<br>
<ul><li>What do like?<br>
</li><li>What don't you like?<br>
</li><li>What features could be made easier to use?<br>
</li><li>How could the help pages be improved?<br>
</li><li>Examples of vulnerabilities that ZAP doesn't detect<br>
</li><li>Examples of false positives that ZAP incorrectly flags</li></ul>

Ideally we'd like example vulnerabilities and false positives in the same format as the ZAP Web Application Vulnerability Examples: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads but if you're not good with JSPs then we'll accept them in any format if necessary!<br>
<br>
<h3>Log issues</h3>
Have you had a problem using ZAP?<br>
If so and its not already been logged then please [report it](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues)

<h3>Localization</h3>
Are you fluent in another language?<br>
Can you help translate ZAP into that language?<br>
If so then just go to http://crowdin.net/project/owasp-zap and get stuck in<br>
<br>
<h3>Development</h3>
If you fancy having a go at adding functionality to ZAP then please get in touch via the<br>
<a href='https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop'>zaproxy-develop Google Group</a>.<br>
We have a list of <a href='https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Projects'>projects</a> on this wiki ideal for people new to ZAP to work on.<br>
Also have a look at some notes about providing new <a href='ScannerRules'>Scanner Rules</a>.<br>
Again, you do not have to be a security expert to contribute code - working on ZAP<br>
could be great way to learn more about web application security!<br>
If you actively contribute to ZAP then you will be invited to join the project.
