# Introduction

---

During GSoC 2012, I've worked (under the mentorship of Simon Bennetts) on developing the Http Sessions Extension. In its current version, it has the ability to identify HTTP Sessions (based on Cookie session tokens), to force the creation of a new session by removing any session tokens and to force all the requests to be on a particular session, by properly setting the session tokens.

The work for this Google of Summer of Code consists of enhancing the HTTP Session handling of ZAP in order to add the capability to set up and/or identify users and roles and in order to add a series of various views, actions and scans that are dependent on a particular user/role.


# Project Goals

---

  * allow users to set up and manage users/roles
  * allow ZAP to understand users/roles and associate them to HTTP Sessions
  * implement a structured mechanism/interface to allow other extensions to handle HTTP Sessions and to send requests from the perspective of a user/role on a per-extension basis
  * allow users to perform various scans (e.g. Spider) from the perspective of a particular user/role
  * allow users to view subsets of the sites present in the Site Tree or History Tab based on a particular user/role
  * allow users to compare which parts of a web application are visible by two different Users/Roles
  * allow users to test access control with a tool that tries to access the URLs that each User/Role shouldn't have access to
  * thorough documentation for the developed parts
  * thorough testing for the implementation
