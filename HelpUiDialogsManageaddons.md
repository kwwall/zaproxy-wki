# Manage Add-ons

This allows you to manage the [add-ons](HelpStartConceptsAddons) that you have installed and download new ones from the Add-on Marketplace.

Two tabs are available:
## Installed
This tab shows you the version of ZAP you are running, all of the installed add-ons and allows you to
check for any updates to ZAP or any of the add-ons.<br>Hovering over an add-on will show you more information<br>
about it. <br>You can also uninstall add-ons from this tab - typically add-ons are dynamically removed from<br>
the ZAP UI as soon as you uninstall them.<br>
<h2>Marketplace</h2>
This tab shows you all of the add-ons that you dont have installed which are available from the Add-on<br>
Marketplace.<br>You will need to 'Check for updates' before you can see the add-ons available.<br>Hovering over<br>
an add-on will show you more information about it. <br>You can install any of the add-ons listed - typically<br>
add-ons are dynamically added to the ZAP UI as soon as you install them.<br>
