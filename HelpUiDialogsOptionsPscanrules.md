# Options Passive Scan Rules screen

This screen allows you to configure the [passive scan](HelpStartConceptsPscan) rules.<br>
<h3>Threshold</h3>
This controls how likely ZAP is to report potential vulnerabilities.<br>If you select Low then more potential<br>
issues will be raised which may increase the number of false positives.<br>If you select High then fewer<br>
potential issues will be raised which may mean that some real issues are missed (false negatives).<br>
